## Task1
i have implemented a basic requirement of it's urgent project i.e, it basically demonstrates that given a contact list of a user, he can see his contacts who else are using the app

## Task2
i have implemented one of the core features that is required for it's urgent project.That is sending notificartion even when the user is in do not disturb mode.
Here is the demonstartion video of it

## Task3
i have created an extension to the above feature that is full screen notification.One thing to note about fullscreen notification is, there is this android policy,when the screen is active(dislaying something) the notification always shows up as heads up notification no matter what type the category of notification is be it call,alarm,.... but only on lock screen it varies.Here is the demonstration video

## Task4

In this task i have demonstrated,
How to identify the dnd status of user when the app is in
1.)  Foreground <br>
2.)  Background <br>
3.)  Terminated <br>
4.)  Terminated and in Do not Disturb mode <br>
5.)  Terminatesd,in DND mode and the phone screen is locked <br>

The main agenda to show this demonstration is because the worst case for this project is,
the app is terminated and user is in Do not disturb mode, someone from his contacts send a notification.Noow,there are no active lines of code to handle this scenario because the app is terminated.So this demonstration successfully handles all scenarios.
