## Task3
i have created an extension to the above feature that is full screen notification.One thing to note about fullscreen notification is, there is this android policy,when the screen is active(dislaying something) the notification always shows up as heads up notification no matter what type the category of notification is be it call,alarm,.... but only on lock screen it varies.Here is the demonstration video

## Task4

In this task i have demonstrated,when the app is terminated,how the background task can be handled 
If the receiver of notification is in DND mode and the app is terminated,in this case we will send a challenge to sender of notification.
now there are no active lines of code working.
How can we send challenge now?
A http request.
we send that request using silent data handle using FCM.
